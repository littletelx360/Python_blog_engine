# Python_blog_engine
A simple engine for a python's web application.

This is a simple structure for a ready to use python blog engine. 
It has some dependencies (see import statements and requirements.txt) and it's meant to be noSQL oriented (Mongo), but you could easily implement a Bottle or Flask application on it and manage severals blogs, each one with its own posts.

I've used severals @staticmethod to avoid maintenance issues related to the classes.
